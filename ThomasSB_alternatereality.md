**A Lambda Hello**

## Hello, from Thomas Sabino-Benowitz

My name is **Thomas Sabino-Benowitz**

Want to know three words that describe me?
Easy.. (that's not one of them)

1.**Child**

2.**Female**

3.**Ant**

Email Sabinowitz@gmail.com for more words

Let's talk about my favorite **Hobby**

My favorite hobby simply must be **fox hunting.**

- It has the advantage of being the best-named hobby.
- It is legal in all countries and counterintuitively requires little money.
- Those who fail to take up this hobby in their early lifetimes seem to universally regret it by old age

Drawbacks include being shamed, and having your hobby described as a **degenerate lifestyle**

Bullying is truly the only degenerate **lifestyle**, and is NOT one of my **hobbies**. **Bullies**-- this page is not for you.

My favorite animal? Also easy (not the name of the animal)

it's the **Chinchilla**,

...

I'm realizing that it's not so easy..

my favorite animal is **Ant**

Thank you very much for accessing this personal page.
